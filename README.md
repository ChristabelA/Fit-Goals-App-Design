Overview: Fitness is a human need but a lot of people have issues navigating how to be fit. There is a lot of information on the internet and it can feel overwhelming trying to figure out how to incoporate all the aspects of fitness into their lives. As a result of this, people easily abandon their fitness journey and never get to achieve fitness goals they set for themselves. 

Problem statement: How may I simplify fitness and help users achieve their fitness goals?

Users and audience: My target audience is young adults, particularly high school and college students, who are trying to navigate adulthood as seamlessly as possible. They do not yet have a set daily routine becasue course schedules change and locations change during during holidays and breaks. They want a fitness journey that will accommodate their schedules and the changes made to it. 

Process and what I have done so far: So far, I have carried out user research on 12 college students. And after talking with them, I have analysed the data and learned about their their needs, pains and gains as it relates to fitness through affinity diagrams and empathy maps. 

Current Process: I am using the infomation I gathered to brainstorm and ideate through ideas that will create a fitness experience that is custom-made to each user and their specific fitness journey. 

Scope and constraints: Coming soon

Outcomes and lessons: Coming soon
